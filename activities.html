    <p>Over the past time I have involved myself with actvities that help me keep fit. These actvities range from riding horses to climbing mountains and hills to book reading.
          Horse riding sounds hard and scary for first timers but once you get used to the horse and get some basic training all will be well.<br><br>
          climbing mountains is really about the physical endurance and the mental toughness. The path to the top is steep,rough and windy hence it needs one to be tough.<br><br>
          Book reading entails patience since one is required to sit for long hours and go page by page. Its easy, you just have to find a silent place with no disturbances and get on with it. <br><br>
		  Swimming on the other hand is risky for first timers. Drowning is real. People who dont know how to swim are encouraged to have a trainer before they are allowed to swim on their own. They can start on the shallow end and proceed to the deep ends once their skills are up to par.<br><br>
		These activites have made me enjoy life more and i enjot doing them.
