			<h3>Family</h3>
		   <p>I am Chemutai  Felistus aka Chemutai and am mostly known as Nicole or <em>Chemu</em>.Iam 22 years old of age and a fifth born in the family of seven. 
			I grew up in a village where we practised domestic farming. We kept few cattle for milk and also practised poutry farming which sustained and even us by
			 gathering for my school fees and my siblings. We grew in a God's fearing family and the church doctrines are well instilled in us. Every member of my family
			  is  hard-working and they have always done that to reciprocated what our parents have been able to offer.

					<h3>Modelling</h3>
				<p>My dream to be a model came into realIty when I was in my third form. I started as a curtain-racerandfinally made it.During the end of my campus studies, I managed to be selected to participate at a contest. love taking pictures and below are some of them.The top most picture was when we had been selected to participate with my two other friends modelling contest sponsored by the Nyeri county government.</p>
				<p>The day was awesome and everything was set in place. The one at the top most  right was when we were doing the last 
				CAT in campus before the final exams.Life has not been easy for me and by that I have learnt to be more careful 
				and everything have done and have gone through has taught me to be patience and hopeful.
				Iam also grateful to the USAID and Master Card Foundation through the bounty of World Bank and Equity group foundation for enabling me go far 
				academic wise. Through them I have been able to fulfill my dreams so far and looking forward to achieving more. 
				I have always wanted to become  a world class developer and thankful to Moringa for granting me chance to polish 
				my skills into becoming one.</p>
